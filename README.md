# dotfiles

Some stuff to setup and customize my working environment. 
It's opinionated and a constant WIP, but feel free to take over what you like...

## Usage

    git clone git@github.com:dsager/dotfiles.git
    ./dotfiles/install

## Acknowledgements

- Some of this was copied shamelessly from [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)' and [anishathalye](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles)'s dotfiles. Thanks!
- The installation runs on [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

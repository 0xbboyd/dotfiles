# dotfiles

Some scripts and [notes](NOTES.md) to setup and customize my working environment (Elementary OS).

This is opinionated and a constant WIP, but feel to look around anyway...

## Usage

    # set up dotfiles folder
    git clone https://github.com/dsager/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

    # use install & config scripts
    cd ./dotfiles/scripts && ls -l

    # set up git workspace
    cd ~/src && gws update

Note to self: Using the https URL is easier on a new machine as no
SSH keys are needed. To work on the repo later on, change the remote
URL to ssh:

    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:dsager/dofiles.git
